This is an OpenAI gym environment designed for the control of dynamical systems expressed as approximations to differential equations using the [Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method).

## Installation

To install `cd` to the directory of the repository and run `pip install -e .`

## Usage

The file `example.py` contains a simple usage example using the [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system). To run the example `cd` to the directory of the repository and run `python example.py`. You should see something like this:
